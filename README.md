**Problem**: Nike and Adidas are rivals in the shoe market and while Nike spends heavily on advertising for market share, Adidas picks their materials in such a way that their products are more affordable. Both their shoes are of comparable quality.

**Solution after analysis**: we see that there are a lot of highly-rated shoes from Nike that outcompete Adidas.
However, Nike has a policy of not offering discounts on these shoes (at the time of preparing this dataset).
Hence, for Nike to acquire more market share, it must sell some of its highly-rated shoes on a discount, and hold it till it captures that portion of the market share from Adidas.
